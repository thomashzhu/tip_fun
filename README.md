Tip Fun is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Time spent: 24 hours spent in total

Imagine you just enjoyed a lovely meal, with friends or families perhaps. How wonderful! But then you get this check that shows some very random bill amount, like $125.63 or $48.65, which you have to then multiple it by 15%, 18%, or whatever. Well, the “fun” doesn’t stop there, because now you have to split it with all other people. That’s it? Maybe not. How about if you suddenly change your mind and want to give the waiter or waitress some more tips? Repeat those steps all over again.

Don’t you think calculating tip should be easier? That’s the purpose of Tip Fun. With Tip Fun, you can easily calculate tip with just several taps. If you usually give out the same percentage of tip, then you can store such information in the app, so that you don’t have to do it EVER AGAIN!

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Split bill with one or multiple people is supported
- [X] Three user-defined default tip percentages are added (great/fine/poor service)
- [X] Single tap to show bill amount entered already includes tip
